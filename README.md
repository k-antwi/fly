## Introduction

Fly is a Laravel applications deployment library arming you with a simple but efficient means to ship code from dev to production. 
Fly is inspired by Sail and as such gives you all the core features of Sail for local development.
Other than Docker, no software or libraries are required to be installed on your local computer before using Fly. Fly's simple CLI means you can start building your Laravel application without any previous Docker experience.

#### Inspiration

Fly is inspired by and derived from [Vessel](https://github.com/shipping-docker/vessel) by [Chris Fidao](https://github.com/fideloper). If you're looking for a thorough introduction to Docker, check out Chris' course: [Shipping Docker](https://serversforhackers.com/shipping-docker).
